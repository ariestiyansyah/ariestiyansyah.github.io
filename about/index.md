Me? I am Rizky Ariestiyansyah student of College School of Indonesian Taxation ^_^ .

My friend said I am young and energic, also PROBLEM MAKER. Everyday awake at 4.30 AM and sleep at 12.00 PM.

I hate the law but like the rules, currently I just accept Freelance work.

Some Organization i contributed and support are @IlmuBerbagi , Indonesian Computer Emergency Response Team, Mozilla, Clean Master, XFCE, Fedora Indonesia and Webmaker project by Mozilla.
