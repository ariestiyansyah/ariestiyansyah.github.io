</h2>

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-344" src="http://oonlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-15-204340-600x156.png" alt="headerparty" width="600" height="156" />][1]

FYI, Maker Party is Mozilla&#8217;s global campaign to teach the web. Through thousands of community-run events around the world, Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic web users with hands-on learning and making.



The schedule of Webmaker party this year is July 15 &#8211; September 15, 2014. You can join Maker Party and help teach the web with online and offline play, exploration and learning through making.

## How does Maker Party work?

  1. Host an Event
  2. Attend an Event
  3. Get Support

### Host an Event

Anyone can host an event in their city or town. Thousands of individual events teaching the culture, mechanics and citizenship of the web make up a global, two-month party.

### Attend an Event

Join Maker Party by attending an event. Visit the [events page][2] and see what&#8217;s happening in your neighbourhood.

### Get Support

Throwing an event? Webmaker Team will support you the entire way with free training and planning resources, ideas for activities, great Mozilla gear like t-shirts and stickers, plus access to a wonderful community and one-on-one support.

    Have fun with Webmaker tools

  <p>
    You can use anything you like to teach the web at your Maker Party event, from the wonderful array of tools available online to good old pencils and paper. Mozilla Webmaker is proud to offer fun, easy-to-use, free <a href="https://webmaker.org/tools">tools</a>: see the inner working of a webpage with <b>X-Ray Goggles</b>; learn HTML and CSS using <b>Thimble</b> and remix video, audio and images from the web with <b>Popcorn Maker.</b>

      You can learn by teaching

    <p>
      The best way to learn the web is to teach it. Hosting a Maker Party is not only personally rewarding, it contributes to the greater goal of increasing web literacy for everyone, everywhere in the world.
