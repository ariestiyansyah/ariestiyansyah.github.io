## Listening Is Your Sure Fire, Go-to Career Strategy

Dude! By “listening” I mean you not only shut your mouth long enough for the other person to talk, but you also shut down the voice in your head when it tries to tell you what to say next. You concentrate on the speakers, and you hear what they say even if it means you have to fight the urge to be defensive or interrupt.

Listen...

- When you're starting something new
- When you're become leader
- When you're trying to make case (hmmmm)
- When you want to look confident
- When you are in the middle (middle yah!)

## Tweak Your Brand to Send Clear Messages

Usually leader:

- Manage appearances (too mainstream)
- Build expetise and let it shine
- Show up like a leader

Try these strategies to manage your brand

- Look in the mirror (people are more likely to regard you as successful if you fit in with the crowd and look professional)
- Research current brand (yours!)
- Promote work (yours!)
- Shape online presence
