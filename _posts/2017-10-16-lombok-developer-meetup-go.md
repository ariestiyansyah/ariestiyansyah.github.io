Overal the event was awesome! I hope there will be a next event to inspire the young generation to continue to learn and explore the world of technology because technology has become an integral part of industry, technology is also the future and DISRUPTIONS! well, you need to anticipate and shape the technological disruption instead of being victimized by it. The IT revolution has touched nearly every human endeavor. Internet usage has grown 183 percent since 2000. The number of Internet users increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013. In 2017, around 40 percent of the worldâ€™s population had an Internet connection, and a wireless hotspot existed for each 150 persons.

Technology Disruptions:

- Medical
- Genetics
- Alternative Energy
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Material Sciences
- Nano Technology

Digital technology is transforming almost every aspect of work life and hence there will be a continuous demand for new skills. One big challenge is that the development of new skills happens at a slower pace than the pace of technology development resulting in the paradoxical situation of simultaneous unemployment and unfilled job vacancies. So you have to learn and partnered with technology if you dont want to disrupted, Keep learn Lombok Developer Community, GO!
