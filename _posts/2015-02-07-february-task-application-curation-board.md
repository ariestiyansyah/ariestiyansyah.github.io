description: Task for Application Curation Board Firefox Marketplace
---

Here is the update for application curation board of Firefox Marketplace in February :

- Nominate any five apps of your choosing.
- Apps by Mozilla Communities -- this was Rizky's idea, and it's a good one! If you know of great apps developed by Mozillians.
- Outer Space Adventures -- this is for featuring outer space-themed games (think: UFOs, aliens, asteroids, etc). 
- Cats! -- Cat-themed games.
- Budapest Spring Festival -- This is for Hungary onlyâ€”any app that might benefit Hungarians celebrating their annual festival.


Happy working team ;) cheers Mozillians!
