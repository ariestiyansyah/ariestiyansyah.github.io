description: Relative capability of each CTO against 10 key business requirements and processes
---
Organizations first need to think through the IT functions, which they currently have in place. Secondly and more importantly, they must decide what additional functions they need. By understanding the way in which the role of the CTO is developing across many industries companies can create a CTO position that will best enhance their own business opportunities. 

Now and in the future it will be important for companies to think strategically about the relationship between technology and their ‘leadership needs.’ In other words, they must assess what kind of technology leadership is required for the growth or stabilization of their company. The issue is not simply the obvious need to keep apace the frightening expansion and development of disruptive technologies: of course this is just one of the factors, which play a part in general competitive strategy. Rather, engineering new types of leadership will impact how an organization maximizes its resources, strengthens its brand, and leverages internal and external relationships. 

This in turn will evolve industries and markets in new and exciting ways.
