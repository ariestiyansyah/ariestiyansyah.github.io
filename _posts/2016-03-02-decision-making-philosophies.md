description: So, what is the right way to think about making decisions?
---

In this thread I want to explain the right way to think about making decisions, divide in 3 decisions.

- Decision Analysis
- Heuristics and Biases
- Going With your gut


### Point of View

- Decision Analysis

Decisions should be made systematically, even in the face of uncertainity. Decision trees provide a framework, and Bayesian statistics provides rules for revising probality assesments.


- Heuristics and Biases

When people make decisions under certain conditions, they rely on rules of thumb, or heuristics, that sometimes yield reasonable judgements but sometimes cause big errors.

- Going With your gut

The heuristics that people use to make decisions are oftem very effective.


### When To use It?

- Decision Analysis

To make big decisions with long investment horizons and reliable data-in oil and gas and pharma; whether to go to grad school. Also in negotiations and group decisions


- Heuristics and Biases

To design better institutions, wanr ourselves away from dumb mistakes, and better understand the priorities of others.

- Going With your gut

In predictable situations with opportunities for learning-firefighting, flying, sports. Also in highly uncertain situations where you cant necessarily rely on data.
