Last time I&#8217;ve created the Cheat cube box of FSA program and upload the result on twitter, after seeing that Vineel send me email to ask about Cheat Cube Box of FSA program i&#8217;ve created, that&#8217;s really good news for me <img src="https://oonlab.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> , another good news is Kate interested with my cheat cube box.

The project was inspired from fedora command line cheat box, so I used the template and edited the cheat. I&#8217;ve granted access from the author before modify and publish the project ^_^ .

Need 1 hours to edited the cube box and add some information about Firefox Student Ambassador program.
