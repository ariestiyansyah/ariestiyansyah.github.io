Wohoooo, november is coming and task for application curation board at <span style="color: #ff6600;">Mozilla Marketplace</span> is ready, last month (<span style="color: #808080;">October</span>) we are working on featured apps for specific theme like <span style="color: #000080;">Action Game</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Relaxing Apps</span> and<span style="color: #800080;"> Seasonal shopping</span> application, and all nominated apps already featured in october.

Have you visited Marketplace lately to app nominations in the spotlight? We just refreshed the ever-present <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/feed/editorial/games?src=branded-editorial-element" target="_blank">“Great Games”</a> collection. And a lot of apps populate the recent <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/feed/editorial/tools-time-savers?src=branded-editorial-element" target="_blank">“Productivity”</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/feed/editorial/creativity?src=branded-editorial-element" target="_blank">&#8220;<wbr />Creativity”</a> collections, this time we are move move and move to prepare next month featured application on Firefox Marketplace aaaaandddd&#8230;.

The November task are :

  * Joshua Smith recommended we do a “<span style="color: #0000ff;">Winter Games</span>” collection. This is a good idea!
  * &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Holiday Apps</span>&#8221; collection, this can be any kind of app related to December holidays (aka Christmas, Hannukah). This could be games, religious apps, or anything else related to the festive season.
  * “<span style="color: #008000;">Strategy Games</span>” should comprise games that focus specifically on the strategy genre, such as turn-based strategy games, war games, board games, etc. I realize all games require a certain level of strategy, but in this case we’re talking about specific games where the primary emphasis is strategy, as opposed to action or puzzle games which may require elements of strategy.

OK that&#8217;s all the task for this month, we are try to serve better featured apps on <span style="color: #ff6600;">Firefox Marketplace</span> <img src="https://oonlab.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> cheers and let&#8217;s do something wonderful for Open Web.
