As mentioned by dietrich he can run fast, hahaha


For 2nd conference day 

My talk is focused on how to build Massive Open Online Course Platform using Flask, I tried to explain

Many attendees came to listen to the my speech showing great interest about the platform

This yearâ€™s PyCon MY talks ranged from topics such as why python is being used in web development, to board game building, to educational uses of python for high school student, to python being used to easily prototype custom protocols, to even community building and diversity.
