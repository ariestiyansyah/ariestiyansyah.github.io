The birds are learning to fly is most beautiful view of the blue sky in the morning, I enjoyed a cup of coffee along the corner of the front yard with my beloved laptop, just rows of code that can be savored to accompany the remains of my life waiting for college completion. Lectures are no longer completed but still imagine in my mind what I would do in the future.

There is always chance and hope for a wonderful future, there is always a path to success in life, there are always obstacles to achieve the beauty of living in this world that full of hypocrisy. Birds in the morning I saw reminded me of high morale to achieve what we want, but the bird was not always going to be able to fly freely because there are times when his wings fall off and also broken until it can no longer reach the highest peak in his life.

Many of my friends ask me about my loneliness that&#8217;s very very not clear (hmm), only with a smile I answered all the questions. There is something that is being defending by me now and I&#8217;m waiting for when it arrives to reveal it, what I think is no longer the same as before because now I think it&#8217;s ready and just waiting for the right moment.

No fatigue retain all of this and I think there&#8217;s no doubt to enhance my life, when scratched I will treat injuries. Hufft knows what else to write but my mind has begun to chaotic and mixed, but I&#8217;m ready for everything.

You know why? The reason to postpone it were not for college, work, and mental readiness but my **RELIGION** <img src="https://oonlab.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
