I started to get into main topic, review about HTML and tell them about some project we need to contribute to mozilla. In the middle of the event all of FSA get the blank paper to be filled with their idea, cause Firefox is 9th in this year all FSA should write 9 idea for mozilla and our Firefox Club.

They are very serious write their ideas, and if you read their ideas there are many fun idea like &#8220;Mozilla paint my room with big firefox logo&#8221;, &#8220;Create Firefox Club anthem music&#8221;, &#8220;Mozilla give me Laptop, please!&#8221;, &#8220;GIVE US SNACK, PLEASE!&#8221;.
