#HackJak is end and all of the winner celebrate the hackjak, also me <img src="https://oonlab.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> . Really proud to join the first jakarta hackathon. All the participants chose to develop an app using either Jakarta’s annual budget information for 2014 or the city’s public transportation route information in the form of an API. Both sets of information have their own specific challenges, like educating citizens about how the government uses its budget and encouraging them to help monitor the execution, or to help streamline how people use Jakarta’s public transportation.
