A good day to get awesome news from Mozilla, like another day I am checking my email every morning. The awesome news is my OpenX Quiz app is featured on Firefox Marketplace, this application is simple and need fast reader and finger (also fast processor of your brain) to use because there are 60 question and only 90 seconds to answer all of that, seems crazy? I think not <img src="https://oonlab.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> .
