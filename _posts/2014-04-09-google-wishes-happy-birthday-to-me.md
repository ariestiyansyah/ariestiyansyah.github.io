I just opened url <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a> today to find new article for learning, as we know google have <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles" target="_blank">doodle</a> the Google logos commemorating holidays and events. Today is different where google show me a Happy Birthday doodle, is this new feature or not? I just know there is feature like this, I thinks is cool. Ayway here is the picture

<div id="attachment_255" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://oonlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-from-2014-04-09-141824.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-255" alt="Doodle Birthday" src="http://oonlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-from-2014-04-09-141824-600x337.png" width="600" height="337" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Doodle Birthday
  </p>
</div>

When I click on the doodle image directly to my <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RizkyAriestiyansyah/about" target="_blank">google plus</a> (G+) page, that&#8217;s really nice and awesome feature from google to make their user happy and enjoy, and thank you very much google with this feature, keep it up and keep it rock the #1 search engine in the world.
