description: Task for Application Curation Board Firefox Marketplace
---

Here is the update for application curation board of Firefox Marketplace in March :

- Retro Games. Think: classic arcade-style gaming. Marketplace has a bunch of really strong content that fits this theme.
- Ninja Games. Marketplace also has a ton of fun ninja gaming content. 
- Geek Apps. This is Rizky's great idea. Let's find apps that help developers do great work. 

Happy working team ;) cheers Mozillians!
