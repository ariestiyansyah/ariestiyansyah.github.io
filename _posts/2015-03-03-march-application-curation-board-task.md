description: Task for Application Curation Board Firefox Marketplace
---

Have you visited Marketplace lately to app nominations in the spotlight? We just refreshed the ever-present “Mozillia Communites” apps collection. And a lot of apps populate the recent “Cats” and “Outer Space Collections” collections, this time we are move move and move to prepare next month featured application on Firefox Marketplace.

Below is the update for application curation board of Firefox Marketplace in March, fyi this curation will be available in marketplace by April :

- <span style="color: #800080;">Retro Games</span>. Think: classic arcade-style gaming. Marketplace has a bunch of really strong content that fits this theme.
- <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Ninja Games</span>. Marketplace also has a ton of fun ninja gaming content. 
- <span style="color: #0000ff;">Geek Apps</span>. This is Rizky's great idea. Let's find apps that help developers do great work. 

Happy working team ;) cheers Mozillians!
